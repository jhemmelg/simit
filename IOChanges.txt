Import/Export Changes

* Attributes can be what?
   * scalars
      * of any supported type
   * vectors
      * or modeled as separate scalars?
   * tensors
      * ditto?
* What if any effort should we make to be type-safe?
   * perhaps not in existing formats, but what about a custom?
   * doesn't seem to be a priority in this field
* allow saving and reading attributes in files that support it
* support separate file to save/read attributes (*.fld)
   * multiple starting conditions
   * checkpointing long simulations
* How do we make sure the object files and attribute files remain in sync?
   * How important is this in general?
* Is there a single "official" format we want to promote?
   * or do we want to do some kind of plugin architecture?
      * is there enough need for this?
* Is there a way to integrate this with other languages smoothly?
   * PySimit? NetworkX?
* What about hdf5 or other similar storage scheme?
* what about other binary formats?
* How does this interact with FieldRefs/TensorRefs?
